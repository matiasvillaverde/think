# Think Freely (OpenClaw App)

A native Apple app that brings OpenClaw to iOS, macOS, and visionOS. The goal is to make OpenClaw easy to install, safe to run in a sandboxed environment (especially on iOS), and approachable for everyday use.

## Status

This project is under active development and is **not ready for production use**. Expect breaking changes, missing features, and incomplete documentation.

## Vision

The goal is to give the world an open-source tool that thinks. This repository is the foundation for a polished, secure, and user-friendly app experience built on OpenClaw.

## What This Is

- An app-focused implementation of OpenClaw for Apple platforms.
- Designed to run in a sandbox (required on iOS) with a clear security model.
- Built with Swift, SwiftUI, and a modular architecture.

## What This Is Not (Yet)

- A stable or fully supported release.
- A complete replacement for the original OpenClaw tooling.

## Platforms

- iOS 18+
- macOS 15+
- visionOS 2+
