# Think (OpenClaw App)

Think is an Apple‑platform app inspired by OpenClaw and transformed into a native iOS/macOS/visionOS experience. The goal is to make OpenClaw easier to use, safer to run in a sandboxed environment (especially on iOS), and approachable for everyday workflows.

## Status

This is an experiment and is **not ready for production use**. Only use it if you understand how it works. Expect breaking changes, missing features, and incomplete documentation.

## Vision

The goal is to give the world an open‑source tool that thinks.

## What This Is

- An app‑focused implementation inspired by OpenClaw for Apple platforms.
- Designed to run in a sandbox (required on iOS) with a clear security model.
- Built with Swift, SwiftUI, and a modular architecture.

## What This Is Not (Yet)

- A stable or fully supported release.
- A complete replacement for the original OpenClaw tooling.

## Platforms

- iOS 18+
- macOS 15+
- visionOS 2+
