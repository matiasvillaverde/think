Calculate 10 divided by 0 and the square root of -4.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
<think>
The user is asking for two calculations that will result in errors:
1. Division by zero (undefined)
2. Square root of negative number (imaginary in real number system)
I should still make the tool calls to show the errors.
</think>

I'll attempt both calculations, though they involve mathematical edge cases.

<tool_call>
{"name": "divide", "arguments": {"a": 10, "b": 0}}
</tool_call>

<tool_call>
{"name": "sqrt", "arguments": {"n": -4}}
</tool_call><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>tool
{"error": "Division by zero", "error_code": "MATH_ERROR", "message": "Cannot divide by zero"}<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>tool
{"error": "Invalid input", "error_code": "MATH_ERROR", "message": "Cannot calculate square root of negative number in real number system"}<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Both calculations resulted in mathematical errors:

1. **10 ÷ 0**: This produces a "Division by zero" error. Division by zero is undefined in mathematics because there's no number that, when multiplied by 0, gives 10.

2. **√(-4)**: This produces an error because we cannot calculate the square root of a negative number in the real number system. In the complex number system, this would be 2i (where i is the imaginary unit), but standard calculators working with real numbers cannot compute this.

These are fundamental mathematical limitations rather than calculation errors. Would you like me to help with any valid calculations instead?<|im_end|>
