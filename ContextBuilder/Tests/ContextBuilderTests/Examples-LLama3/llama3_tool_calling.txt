Calculate the total number of goals scored in that final match including the penalty shootout.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

<|python_tag|>
# Regular time and extra time: 3-3 (6 goals total)
regular_goals = 6

# Penalty shootout: Argentina 4-2 France (6 successful penalties)
penalty_goals = 4 + 2

# Total goals
total_goals = regular_goals + penalty_goals
print(f"Total goals in the match: {total_goals}")
print(f"Breakdown: {regular_goals} in regular/extra time + {penalty_goals} in penalties")

Total goals in the match: 12
Breakdown: 6 in regular/extra time + 6 in penalties<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
