What is the sum of all prime numbers between 10 and 20?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

<|start_thinking|>
I need to find all prime numbers between 10 and 20.
Let me check each number:
- 11: Only divisible by 1 and 11 → Prime
- 12: Divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6 → Not prime
- 13: Only divisible by 1 and 13 → Prime
- 14: Divisible by 2, 7 → Not prime
- 15: Divisible by 3, 5 → Not prime
- 16: Divisible by 2, 4, 8 → Not prime
- 17: Only divisible by 1 and 17 → Prime
- 18: Divisible by 2, 3, 6, 9 → Not prime
- 19: Only divisible by 1 and 19 → Prime
- 20: Divisible by 2, 4, 5, 10 → Not prime

Prime numbers between 10 and 20: 11, 13, 17, 19
Sum: 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 = 60

The prime numbers between 10 and 20 are: 11, 13, 17, and 19.

The sum of these prime numbers is:
11 + 13 + 17 + 19 = 60<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Is 60 divisible by 3?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

<|start_thinking|>
To check if 60 is divisible by 3, I can:
1. Divide 60 by 3: 60 ÷ 3 = 20 (no remainder)
2. Or use the divisibility rule: sum of digits must be divisible by 3
   6 + 0 = 6, and 6 is divisible by 3
Both methods confirm 60 is divisible by 3.
<|end_thinking|>

Yes, 60 is divisible by 3. 

60 ÷ 3 = 20 exactly, with no remainder.<|eot_id|>
