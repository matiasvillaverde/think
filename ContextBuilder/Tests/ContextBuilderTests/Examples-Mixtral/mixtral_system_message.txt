What's the proper way to make a béchamel sauce? [/INST]Ah, béchamel sauce! One of the five mother sauces of French cuisine. Here's the traditional method:

**Classic Béchamel Sauce**

**Ingredients:**
- 40g butter
- 40g plain flour
- 500ml whole milk
- 1 bay leaf
- 1/4 onion (studded with 2-3 cloves)
- Pinch of nutmeg
- Salt and white pepper

**Method:**

1. **Infuse the milk**: Heat the milk gently with the bay leaf and clove-studded onion for 10 minutes. Don't let it boil. Strain and keep warm.

2. **Make the roux**: Melt butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat. Add flour and whisk continuously for 2-3 minutes to cook out the raw flour taste. The roux should be pale and smooth.

3. **Add milk gradually**: Remove from heat briefly, then add the warm milk in small amounts, whisking constantly after each addition to prevent lumps.

4. **Simmer**: Return to low heat and simmer gently for 10-15 minutes, stirring frequently, until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.

5. **Season**: Add nutmeg, salt, and white pepper to taste.

The key is patience and constant whisking. The sauce should be silky smooth with no lumps. Use immediately or press plastic wrap directly on the surface to prevent a skin forming.</s>[INST] What dishes commonly use this sauce? [/INST]Béchamel is incredibly versatile in French cuisine!
