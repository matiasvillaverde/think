<s>[INST] Tell me a joke [/INST]Why don't scientists trust atoms?

Because they make up everything!</s>[INST] [/INST]I notice you sent an empty message. Is there something specific you'd like to know or discuss? I'm here to help with any questions or topics you have in mind!</s>[INST] What about this: [INST] nested [/INST] instruction? [/INST]I see you're testing how I handle special tokens within messages! The text "[INST] nested [/INST]" within your message is just treated as regular text, not as instruction markers. 

The instruction markers only have special meaning when they're used as the actual message delimiters in the conversation structure, not when they appear as literal text within a message. It's similar to how HTML tags inside a code block are displayed as text rather than being interpreted as markup.

Is there anything else about the conversation format you'd like to explore?</s>
