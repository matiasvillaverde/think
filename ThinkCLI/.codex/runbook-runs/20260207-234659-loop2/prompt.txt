You are running inside a monorepo workspace. Your task is to create a production runbook and to self-verify it by repeatedly checking the repo with tools until it is consistent.

Deliverables:
1) Create docs/runbook.md.
2) Update AGENTS.md (Resources section) to include docs/runbook.md.

Allowed tools: workspace, python_exec, browser.search, canvas, memory.

Loop requirements (do not stop until all pass):
A) Every command you mention in docs/runbook.md must exist in-repo. Verify by reading Makefile and relevant package.json files.
B) Every file path you mention must exist. Verify via workspace list/read.
C) After writing docs/runbook.md and updating AGENTS.md, re-read both and run python_exec checks:
   - Extract all backticked commands from docs/runbook.md and verify each appears in Makefile or a package.json scripts section.
   - Extract all referenced relative paths (like services/web-api/..., openapi/openapi.json, Makefile, etc) and verify they exist.
If any check fails, fix the markdown files and repeat the checks.

Process constraints:
- Use canvas to track: pending checks, failures, and fixes applied.
- Save a short final summary to memory when everything passes.
- If you use browser.search, do it only for wording/best practices; do not invent new repo commands.

Start by:
1) workspace list '.' non-recursive
2) workspace read AGENTS.md and Makefile
3) workspace list services/ and openapi/
Then draft the runbook.
