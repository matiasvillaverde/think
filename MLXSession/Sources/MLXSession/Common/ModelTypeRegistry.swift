/// This class is marked `@unchecked Sendable` because:
/// - It contains mutable state (`creators` dictionary) that is protected by explicit synchronization (`NSLock`)
/// - All mutations are guarded by lock-protected critical sections
/// - The lock ensures that all dictionary accesses are properly serialized
///
/// Safety guarantees:
/// - Atomic operations: All reads and writes to `creators` are protected by NSLock
/// - Thread-safe registration: Multiple threads can safely register model creators
/// - Thread-safe creation: Model instantiation from the registry is thread-safe
/// - No data races: The lock serializes all access to the mutable dictionary
/// - Small critical sections: Lock contention is minimal due to short operations
